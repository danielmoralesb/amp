# amp
 In my current Consultation Job a client approached us in search of a way to help get their ranking higher. After doing their own research, they concluded that AMP would be a good tool for them. At the time, we did not know much about AMP other than passive knowledge. My goal was to take a subset of their pages and convert them to AMP. There was a slight problem though, I didn't know AMP. So, like any developer I was off on a hunt for information. This article is my journey of learning AMP. Hopefully, you dear reader, will not have to suffer as I have when picking up something completely new. This will not be a comprehensive list of what AMP is capable of but more of a recap of the things I struggled with or wish I would have known in the beginning.
